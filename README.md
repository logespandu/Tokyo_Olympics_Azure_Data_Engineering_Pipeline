Tokyo 2021 Olympics Dataset ETL Pipeline with Azure Services
📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline leveraging Microsoft Azure services to process and analyze the Tokyo 2021 Olympics dataset. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with Azure tools while integrating various services for data ingestion, storage, transformation, and visualization. Although this is primarily a learning-focused project, it establishes a solid framework for scalable and efficient data workflows.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes five CSV files related to the Tokyo 2021 Olympics:

Athletes: Information about athletes who participated in the Olympics.
Coaches: Data about the coaches associated with various teams and events.
EntriesGender: Breakdown of participants by gender.
Medals: Records of medal winners categorized by event and country.
Teams: Information about participating teams.
🔧 Azure Services Used
1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
A cloud-based ETL service for data ingestion.
Pipelines were created to copy raw data from a GitHub repository into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
Used as the central storage for both raw and transformed data.
Data was organized into the following folders:
RawData: Contains unprocessed data directly imported from the source.
TransformedData: Stores cleaned and processed data.
3. Azure Databricks
Analytics platform built on Apache Spark, used for data transformation.
Key operations performed:
Schema validation.
Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.
Writing transformed data back into ADLS Gen2.
4. Azure Synapse Analytics
A data warehousing service for querying transformed data.
Transformed data was imported into a SQL pool for structured storage and analysis.
5. Power BI 
A business intelligence tool intended for data visualization.
Integrated with Synapse Analytics for dashboard creation (currently out of the project's scope).
🛠️ ETL Process
1. Data Ingestion
Raw data was ingested from a GitHub repository via ADF pipelines.
The data was stored in the raw-data folder in ADLS Gen2.
2. Data Transformation
Data transformation was performed using PySpark in Azure Databricks:
Loaded CSV files into PySpark DataFrames.
Validated schemas and cleaned missing values.
Transformed data was written to the transformed-data folder in ADLS Gen2.
3. Data Warehousing
Transformed data was connected to Azure Synapse Analytics.
Tables were created in a SQL pool to enable querying and analysis.
4. Visualization (In Progress)
Power BI integration was initiated to create interactive dashboards.
The planned reports will include:
Medal distribution analysis.
Gender-based participation trends.
Team performance insights.
✨ Key Features
Seamless Integration: Combines Azure services for an efficient data pipeline.
Scalability: Uses ADLS Gen2 and Synapse Analytics to handle large datasets.
Advanced Data Processing: Utilizes PySpark for efficient transformations.
Analytics-Ready Data: Prepares structured data suitable for querying and visualization.
